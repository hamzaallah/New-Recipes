    <h4>Finished Product</h4>
    <p>Here you will find the decadent and illustrious Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookie in all it's glory</p>

    <p>Many try to copy it, but few <em>succeed</em>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.</li>
        <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
    
    <p>will most likely be thirsty after this and the bread (if you actually did them...)</p>
